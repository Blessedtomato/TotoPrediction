Artificial Neural Networks can also be referred to as Multilayer perceptrons. Its singular nature allows it to adapt to basic binary patterns through a series of inputs, simulating the learning patterns of a human-brain. A Multilayer perceptron is the classic neural network model consisting of more than 2 layers.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were invented to be used around predicting sequences. LSTM (Long short-term memory) is a popular RNN algorithm with many possible use cases
